## Contribution

Contributions in the form of reporting issues or submitting pull
requests are welcome! Please use the available tools as described here
to ensure your changes of the code could be merged. As this project
addresses primarily a special group of users (students/teachers) and
must retain compatibility to the software and devices developed by
desklab (some of which may not be public yet), there may be some
additional requirements, which can not be covered by automated tests.
Therefore you should not hesitate to contact us via orga@desk-lab.de or
by opening an issue, if you are planning to contribute to this project,
such that we could discuss the best way to go forward. Submitted code
changes are understood to be under the same license that covers the
project.
