## Contribution

Contributions in the form of reporting issues or submitting pull requests are welcome! Please use the available tools as
described here to ensure your changes of the code could be merged. As this project addresses primarily a special group
of users (students/teachers) and must retain compatibility to the software and devices developed by desklab (some of
which may not be public yet), there may be some additional requirements, which can not be covered by automated tests.
Therefore you should not hesitate to contact us via orga@desk-lab.de or by opening an issue, if you are planning to
contribute to this project, such that we could discuss the best way to go forward. Submitted code changes are understood
to be under the same license that covers the project.
