        Some access keys of the course you registered on GewässerCampus
        (course name: {{ name }}, school: {{ school }}) have been
        deactivated as they have been created more than {{ days }} days
        ago.<br>
        Students can now no longer use these access keys to create new
        measurements or edit their old measurements.<br>
        You can always re-activate access keys in the
        <a href="{{ course_url }}">course administration</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you think this happened on accident, or you never registered
        a course on GewässerCampus, don't hesitate to contact us.
