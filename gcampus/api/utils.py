    Get the coordinates (two points at the corners) describing a square
    bounding box of size ``size``, located at ``center``.
    To easily calculate the position of these corners relative to
    the center point, the coordinate system is transformed into
    EPSG:3857 WGS 84, a coordinate system that uses meters instead of
    longitude and latitude. The points that are returned will be
    transformed back to the original coordinate system. If the center
    point has no specified coordinate system (i.e. srid == None), an
    srid of 4326 (EPSG:4326 WGS 84) is assumed as a sensible default.

    :param center: The center point
    :param size: The square edge size. If size is a number (e.g. ``int``
        or ``float``), the unit will be meters. The parameter can also
        be of type Distance to easily convert between different units.
